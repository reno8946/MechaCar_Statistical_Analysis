## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Vehicle length, ground clearance and intercept provide non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. In other words, vehicle length and ground clearance have a statistically significant impact on MPG, and the intercept is statistically significant which means that there are other significant variables and factors not included in the model.

### There is not enough evidence to conclude that the slope of the linear model is zero because vehicle length and ground clearance are non-random and have a statistically significant impact on MPG.

### Since the intercept is statistically significant and there are other significant variables and factors not included in the model, this model fails to predict future mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

### The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. The current manufacturing data does not meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total as the variance for Lot 3 exceeds it by nearly 70 psi. However, lots 1 and 2 do not exceed the variance limit.
