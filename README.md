# Vehicle length, ground clearance and intercept provide non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. In other words, vehicle length and ground clearance have a statistically significant impact on MPG, and the intercept is statistically significant which means that there are other significant variables and factors not included in the model.

# There is not enough evidence to conclude that the slope of the linear model is zero because vehicle length and ground clearance are non-random and have a statistically significant impact on MPG.

# Since the intercept is statistically significant and there are other significant variables and factors not included in the model, this model fails to predict future mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
